    <h2>Introduction </h2>
    <p> I am a graduate of Social Auxiliary Work from Joburg Child Welfare, Aganang. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at ALX, where I am developing technical skills to complement my background in social work. My passion lies in creating impactful solutions that bridge the gap between technology and community welfare.</p>

    <h2>Project </h2>
    <p> I am currently building my first website, titled "My First Portfolio," as a personal showcase of my journey and skills. The website includes several sections: an Introduction that gives an overview of who I am, my background, and my aspirations; a Projects section where I showcase the work I'm doing and the technologies I'm learning in Software Engineering; an About Me section that delves into my journey, values, and what drives me in both tech and social work; and a Contact section for visitors to reach out for collaboration, feedback, or inquiries. This project marks an exciting step in my transition from social auxiliary work to software development and reflects my growth in both fields.</p>
